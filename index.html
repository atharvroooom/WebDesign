    <blockquote>
      <p>
        An astonishingly articulate and an erudite personality; in the age old war between Jerusalem and  Athens, Hitchens was a champion for the latter. Unrelenting in his defense of the rational and poetic, he spent most of his life fighting for free speech and freedom of inquiry. Undoubtedly so, he managed to raise awareness in the global concsious against dogmatism and fanaticism.
        Bereft of words to end this tribute to do justice to his work, I leave with a quote of his own- quite a condensation of his core values as an individual.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p> My own opinion is enough for me, and I claim the right to have it defended against any consensus, any majority, anywhere, anyplace, anytime. And anyone who disagrees with this can pick a number, get in line, and kiss my arse.
      </p>
